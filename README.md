Module4 Challenge

Unfortunately ran out of time for this homework challenge.

Lots of difficulties getting Jupyter working on my Mac (Ipython) and professional commitments ate into time very much needed to get more familiar with Pandas.

I have provided a number of files which in essence 'attempts' at getting through the work load

The file PyCitySchools.ipynb is in essence what was successfully completed.

Thanks for assessing. May have to write this one off...

cheers David
